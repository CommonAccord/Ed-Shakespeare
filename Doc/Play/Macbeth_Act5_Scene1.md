Act 5, Scene 1


Ti=SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

Instruction.1=Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman

1.Ti=Doctor

1.sec=I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

2.Ti=Gentlewoman

2.sec=Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

3.Ti=Doctor

3.sec=A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?

4.Ti=Gentlewoman

4.sec=That, sir, which I will not report after her.

5.Ti=Doctor

5.sec=You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

6.Ti=Gentlewoman

6.1.sec=Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to confirm my speech.

Instruction.2=Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper

6.2.sec=Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

6.=[Bit/Ssec_02]

7.Ti=Doctor

7.sec=How came she by that light?

8.Ti=Gentlewoman

8.sec=Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her command.

9.Ti=Doctor

9.sec=You see, her eyes are open.

10.Ti=Gentlewoman

10.sec=Ay, but their sense is shut.

11.Ti=Doctor

11.sec=What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

12.Ti=Gentlewoman

12.sec=It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands: I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.

13.Ti=LADY MACBETH

13.sec=Yet here's a spot.

14.Ti=Doctor

14.sec=Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

15.Ti=LADY MACBETH

15.sec=Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, mylord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?--Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.

16.Ti=Doctor

16.sec=Do you mark that?

17.Ti=LADY MACBETH

17.sec=The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?-- What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting.

18.Ti=Doctor

18.sec=Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

19.Ti=Gentlewoman

19.sec=She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.

20.Ti=LADY MACBETH

20.sec=Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

21.Ti=Doctor

21.sec=What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

22.Ti=Gentlewoman

22.sec=I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

23.Ti=Doctor

23.sec=Well, well, well,--

24.Ti=Gentlewoman

24.sec=Pray God it be, sir.

25.Ti=Doctor

25.sec=This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.

26.Ti=LADY MACBETH

26.sec=Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave.

27.Ti=Doctor

27.sec=Even so?

28.Ti=LADY MACBETH

28.sec=To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate: come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

Instruction.3=Exit

29.Ti=Doctor

29.sec=Will she go now to bed?

30.Ti=Gentlewoman

30.sec=Directly.

31.Ti=Doctor

31.sec=Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds. Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds. To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets: More needs she the divine than the physician. God, God forgive us all! Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. I think, but dare not speak.

32.Ti=Gentlewoman

32.sec=Good night, good doctor.

Instruction.4=Exeunt
